    "Hello all, and warm welcome to Edinburgh University Clarinet Choir’s Winter Concert 2019!",
    "After a last-minute scramble for rehearsal space at the beginning of the semester, the Choir has grown in both size and spirit, welcoming almost 20 new members to our ranks so far! We’ve been having an absolute blast over the last three months with our weekly rehearsals, board game nights, group meals, pub crawls and busking sessions out and around Edinburgh.",
    "Tonight, we have a wide range of music for you to enjoy - everything from English folk songs to K-pop, as well as a plethora of arrangements from both our own members and our fabulous conductor and Musical Director, Beth Appelquist. There should be something for everybody, so we hope you’re as excited to get started as we are!",
    "During the break, we’re hosting a bake sale by donation in support of the Bethany Christian Trust’s Care Shelter. Every year, the Bethany Christian Trust (SC003783) along with around 1,000 volunteers from across Edinburgh and the Lothians provide shelter and hot meals to hundreds of homeless during the winter months. It deeply saddens me to think of those left out on the street alone, especially as we approach our winter celebrations, so I would like to thank each and every one of you who is able to make a donation tonight of whatever is within your means."
