  "description": "From Jupiter to the banks of the Danube, we present music to whisk you away to distant times and places, both on earth and beyond. This is the most ambitious concert we have put on to date — in my opinion anyway! The music this semester includes some old favourites, some new acquisitions and some pieces arranged by members of the society. Despite some unexpected interference in our rehearsal schedule due to the Beast from the East, we hope that you enjoy our concert tonight.",
  "pieces": [{
      "title": "Light Cavalry Overture",
      "composer": "Franz von Suppé",
      "arranger": "James Shaw",
      "description": ["Premiering in Vienna in 1866, the Light Cavalry Overture is one of von Suppé's most popular compositions, and now quite distinct from the operetta of which it originally formed a part. Many orchestras around the world have the piece in their repertoire, and the main theme of the overture has been quoted numerous times by musicians, cartoons and other media. In the original operetta, the eponymous light cavalry is a joke about the arrival of several overweight dancers, and it contains no actual cavalry! Our arrangement was made by our president James, and features a cadenza from Sarah on E♭."]

      "description": ["First released in April 1965, 'Ticket to Ride' was the Beatles' seventh consecutive number one single in the UK. Its meaning is disputed, as is its authorship. Our arrangement was an impulse purchase before Christmas, and we're still not convinced by it!"]

      "title": "Highlights from Carnival of the Animals",
      "composer": "Camille Saint-Saëns",
      "arranger": "Alard de Boer",
      "description": [
        "'Le Carnaval des Animaux' is a suite written in 1886 describing different animals through the use of different instruments and styles. It is widely regarded as a series of musical jokes. It borrows heavily from other works, much to the annoyance of Saint-Saëns' contemporaries. Our arrangement includes five movements in no particular order.",
        "'L'Éléphant' (The Elephant) features Elly on bass clarinet. The joke here is that the music was originally written by Mendelssohn and Berlioz for much higher instruments.",
        "'Le Coucou au Fond des Bois' (The Cuckoo in the Depths of the Woods) features Franz doing his best to imitate the cuckoo, which in the original score is marked as 'offstage'.",
        "'Les Personnages à Longues Oreilles' (Persons with Long Ears) is a solo for E♭ Clarinet played by Sarah. It depicts a pair of donkeys (or as some interpretations see it, music critics).",
        "'Le Cygne' (The Swan), the most famous movement of this suite, features the Alto Clarinet wielded by Joe.",
        "'Fossiles' (Fossils) is largely regarded as a musical joke on the composer's part as the eponymous fossils are the other composers around at the same time! It includes themes from 'Ah! Vous dirai-je maman' (AKA 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'), other French nursery rhymes and themes from operas such as the Barber of Seville.",
      "We are also performing it this evening with the introductory poems by Ogden Nash, which adds still a little more colour to an already colourful piece."

      "arranger": "Mike Walton",
      "description": [
        "'An der schönen blauen Donau', composed in 1866, is widely regarded to be Johann Strauss II's masterpiece. When Strauss's stepdaughter asked the Johannes Brahms to sign her autograph-fan, he wrote down the first bars of The Blue Danube, but adding \"Leider nicht von Johannes Brahms\" (\"Alas! not by Johannes Brahms\").",
        "It is most famously performed annually at the Wiener Philharmoniker's New Year's Day concert, in which it is always the penultimate piece, and is interrupted by the conductor turning to the audience during the introduction saying \"Die Wiener Philharmoniker und ich wünschen Ihnen 'Prosit Neujahr'\" (\"The Vienna Philharmonic wishes you a Happy New Year\").",
        "It is a very typical Viennese Waltz, which is a fast, rotary dance which moves quickly around the floor. It is regarded within ballroom dancing circles as being the dancing equivalent of a sprint."

It includes the hymn tune 'Thaxted', which is better known as \"I Vow to Thee My Country\" and \"World in Union\" (the theme song for the Rugby World Cup). It evokes both a sense of fun and, according to Holst, \"the more ceremonial type of rejoicing associated with religious or national festivities.\""]

It is inspired by the Roma culture and further builds upon by the full range of central European folk music. This is the fifth in the series, is definitely the most well-known, and is approximately in the style of a czárdás."]
